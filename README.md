## Search twitter words
Search for tweets according to account / words pair and create and issue in gitlab

For this code to works you will need to have 3 files in the same path:

* twitter_account.txt: here are the account you want to look for (one by line)
* words.txt: here are the words you want to search for (one by line)
* result.json: here is where the search results are going to be stored and this is the file to inspect to create the issues on gitlab


**Note:** The use of TXT format files is to allow easy editing by anyone
